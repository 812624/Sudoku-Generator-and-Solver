CPP code to generate and solve sudoku

# INTRODUCTION	  : 

	 This a minn-project on sudoku solver and genertor.
	 
# LANGUAGE USED	  :
		
	C++.
			
# ALGORITHM USED  :
 
    Backtrack.
		
# DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT :

# MODULES INCLUDED :
			1). myHeader.cpp
			2). main.cpp	    
			3). input.cpp  
			4). solver.cpp   
			5). generator.cpp
			
# CONFIGURATION	   :	
		
	- All files are configured together with a header file "myHeader.cpp", having all other essential header files
	  and function declarations.
	- main.cpp habdles the case if user want to generate sudoku or want to solve her own problem.
	- input.cpp takes file name as input from user and check for it's validity.
	- As their name signifies, both solver.cpp and generator.cpp are coded to solve and generate sudoku problem respectively.
	
# COMMON MISTAKES  :

    - All files related to mini-project must be placed at same place
    - Inputs in the file must be in specified/given manner
    - myHeader.cpp must be included in every file

# COMPILE AND RUN  :

	- compilation  -> g++ myHeader.cpp main.cpp input.cpp solver.cpp generator.cpp
	- run          -> ./a.out
